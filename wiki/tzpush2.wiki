#tzpush2 .

= Introduction =

tzpush2 will allow you to choose which server address book to use.


= Details =

tzpush2 allows you to sync multiple address books. Each combination of Thunderbird AddressBook and Server AddressBook is sent as if a different device.

If upgrading fom tzpush1. Allow at least one sync, then your device name and address book mappings will show under the "Address Book Options" tab.

To add another "Device" (set of address book mappings), select the Thunderbird address book in "Local Address Book" , then select the server address book in "Server Address Book". Enter a name for new "device" in the box to the right of "save as new device", and save.

Tzpush will now sync both combinations.

I would suggest not setting auto sync time to less than 5.
