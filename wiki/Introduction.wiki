Plugin for Thunderbird to Sync Adressbook with Z-Push

= Introduction =

Plugin for Thunderbird to Sync Adressbook with Z-Push.(Zentyal/Zarafa).
Please test.
It will get address book from server and upload Thunderbird address book to server.


Also the default for Z-push on Zentyal seems to be http, so this is set in my plugin.



= Details =
Have added support for provisioning, so no need to do anything to server.

It has no conflict resolution. Best to start with an empty address book at either end.

You can create a new address book and select that from tz-push.
