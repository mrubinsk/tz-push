Plugin for Thunderbird to Sync Adressbook with Z-Push

= Introduction =

Plugin for Thunderbird to Sync Adressbook with Z-Push.(Zentyal/Zarafa).
Please test.
It will get address book from server and upload Thunderbird address book to server. 
I am using loose provisioning on server. See http://www.zarafa.com/wiki/index.php/Z-Push_Provisioning
I am looking at provisioning now. Option for this on Version 0.8.

Also the default for Z-push on Zentyal seems to be http, so this is set in my plugin.
Please test https://.


= Details =

It has no conflict resolution. Best to start with an empty address book at either end.

You can create a new address book and select that from tz-push.

Will delete card from Thunderbird if deleted from Server, but will not pass delete from Thunderbird to Server.

Now will pass modification on cards from Z-Push to Thunderbird.

Will now pass modification to cards from Thunderbird to Z-Push.
