Plugin for Thunderbird to Sync Adressbook with Z-Push

= Introduction =

Plugin for Thunderbird to Sync Adressbook with Z-Push.(Zentyal/Zarafa).
Please test.
It will get address book from server and upload Thunderbird address book to server.


Also the default for Z-push on Zentyal seems to be http, so this is set in my plugin.
Please test https://.


= Details =
Have added support for provisioning, so no need to do anything to server.

It has no conflict resolution. Best to start with an empty address book at either end.

You can create a new address book and select that from tz-push.

Will delete card from Thunderbird if deleted from Server, but will not pass delete from Thunderbird to Server.

Now will pass modification on cards from Z-Push to Thunderbird.

Will now pass modification to cards from Thunderbird to Z-Push.
