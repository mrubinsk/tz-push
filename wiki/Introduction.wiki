Plugin for Thunderbird to Sync Adressbook with Z-Push

= Introduction =

Plugin for Thunderbird to Sync Adressbook with Z-Push.(Zentyal/Zarafa).
Please test.
At the moment it will get address book from server and upload Thunderbird address book to server. 
I am using loose provisioning on server. See http://www.zarafa.com/wiki/index.php/Z-Push_Provisioning
Also the default for Z-push on Zentyal seems to be http, so this is set in my plugin.
Please test https://.


= Details =

It has no conflict resolution. Best to start with an empty address book at either end.

Will delete card from Thunderbird if deleted from Server, but will not pass delete from Thunderbird to Server.

Now will pass modification on cards from Server to Thunderbird.

Will not yet pass modification to cards from Thunderbird to Z-Push. (Should be soon)
