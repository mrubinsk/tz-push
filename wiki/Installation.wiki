Installation.

= Introduction =

I uploaded an old non-working xpi. It has been removed. Will upload new one soon.

Download tzpush.zip, unzip and install xpi
Configuration and Sync button are under tools menu.
Enter Server address and password.
SyncKey and FolderId boxes are for information only.
Will hide password, and add to Thunderbird password soon.


= Details =

Works for me. But at the moment I suggest just testing.
Create new user/profile?
